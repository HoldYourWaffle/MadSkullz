#####THIS MOD IS STILL IN BETA, THIS IS THE MOST RECENT VERSION BUT IT _WILL_ CONTAIN UNFINISHED/UNSTABLE FEATURES!

# MadSkullz
Minecraft mod that lets you get mob-skulls in survival.

# Plans
**Before release-v1.0 the following things must be added in:**
- Custom block for skulls (development in the [own-skull-block](https://github.com/ShadowCoder69/MadSkullz/tree/own-skull-block) branch)
- Axes have higher chance to chop a head than swords
- Player skin-heads caching to prevent lag-spikes (refresh cache on initialization?)
- Chopper achievement (for when you first chop a head)
- Chopper enchantment to increase chance of a chop
